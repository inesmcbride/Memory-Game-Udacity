# Memory Game Project

## About this Memory Game

Aim: Match all the cards to win - Click on the cards to turn them around, and test your memory by matching all 8 pairs!

You start with three stars, but as you hit more than 10 moves, your star count goes down to two, and as you hit 18 moves your star count goes down to one. - Work your memory and try and beat your best time!

Visually pleasing, the cards are animated to bring life to the screen. A responsive grid is set up to ensure you can play on any device, wherever you are!

## Backgound
Project developed as part of Udacity's Front-end Web Developer Nanodegree. The purpose of this project was to practce and develop new Javascript skills learnt through the course.

Udacity provided base HTML & CSS code to get strated with.

Helping me get started with my JavaScript code was Mike Wales [Youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rUH-sEs68Y) and Matthre Cranford's [walkthrough blog](https://matthewcranford.com/memory-game-walkthrough-part-1-setup/).

[The Animate Library](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) was used to bring movement to the cards.
