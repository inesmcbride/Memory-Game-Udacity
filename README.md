## Instructions

Aim: Match all the cards to win

Click on the cards to turn them around, and test your memory by matching all 8 pairs!

You start with three stars, but as you hit more than 10 moves, your star count goes down to two, and as you hit 18 moves your star count goes down to one.

Work your memory and try and beat your best time!

## Dependencies

The HTML and CSS base code was provided by Udacity.

Helping me get started with my JavaScript code was Mike Wales [Youtube tutorial] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rUH-sEs68Y) and Matthre Cranford's [walkthrough blog] (https://matthewcranford.com/memory-game-walkthrough-part-1-setup/).

The Animate Library was used to create interesting animation on the cards. (https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/)
